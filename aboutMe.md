# About: Coby Yates
I am married with a 2 year old and 2 week old daughters. I am taking 20 credits right now and I have really
enjoyed web development so far. I am a senior and know HTML and CSS really well. I still struggle at times 
with JS, but I have been building a few webpages in Vue.js and it has really opened my eyes to how much 
better it can make a website. I still have much to learn.
